# World_Weather_Analysis
by Bob Ciminera

## Overview

 The purpose of this analysis is to build a user interface that will allow customers to filter for their ideal hotel anywhere in the world based on temperature and other weather parameters.
 
 ## Approach

Using Jupyter Notebook and API calls from OpenWeatherMap and Google we:

- Created random coordinates of world cities
- Collected and plotted weather data
- Determined correlations between latitude and temperature, humidity, windspeed and percent cloudiness
- Created heatmaps based on weather parameters for the world cities based on google maps api calls
- Developed a vacation selection criteria based on preferred temperature ranges 
- Built a 4 city vacation itinerary 


## Results

Following are screen shots with key conclusions from the analysis.

Latitude and Temperature are highly correlated:
